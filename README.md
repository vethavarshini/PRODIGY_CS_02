# PRODIGY_CS_02
# Pixel manipulation for Image Encryption 

This project demonstrates how to perform pixel manipulation for image encryption in Python using PIL (Python Imaging Library).

## Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypt images by manipulating pixel values.
- **Decryption**: Decrypt encrypted images by reversing the encryption process.
- **User Interface**: Intuitive GUI for easy image encryption and decryption.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling for file existence.
- **Feedback**: Provides feedback to the user about the success or failure of encryption and decryption operations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/pixel_manipulation_for_image_encryption.py.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd pixel_manipulation_for_image_encryption.py
    ```

3. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python pixel_manipulation_for_image_encryption.py
    ```

4. Click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the displayed image.

5. Click the "Decrypt" button to decrypt the encrypted image.
